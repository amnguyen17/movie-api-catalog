React based web application that allows users to browse popular movies, search by title, and manage a list of favorite films using local storage. It integrates with The Movie Database API using a secure API key to fetch real time movie data. 

Through this project, I gained hands on experience working with external APIs, managing global state using React Context, and persisting data with localStorage to enhance user experience.
