React based web application that allows users to browse popular movies, search by title, and manage a list of favorite films using local storage. It integrates with The Movie Database API using a secure API key to fetch real time movie data. 

This project allowed me to experiment with external APIs and utilizing data with localStorage to enhance user experience using React.
